<p><br><h3><font color="brown">According to its illustrious history, Rizal Park was originally built in a viscous patch of area known as Paseo de la Luneta near Manila Bay in the year 1820 during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines. Luneta Park came from the word lunette which means a crescent-shaped structure used for fortifications in the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries. Formerly, the park was well known to many Filipinos as Bagumbayan since 1601.</font></h3></br></p>
<p><br><h3><font color="brown">Fast forward, Bagumbayan presently known as Rizal Park is the location where Jose Rizal was executed by the Spanish firing squad on December 30, 1896. Subsequently, the death of doctor Jose P. Rizal sparked the Philippine Revolution in the year 1896 against the Spanish rulers. In the year 1901, during the American colonial period of the Philippines, Rizal Monument was designed and constructed with the help of the Philippine Assembly Act No. 243. It states that a monument shall be built in the public land of Luneta in the honor and commemoration of the Philippine patriot, reformist, novel writer, and hero Jose Rizal.</font></h3></br></p>
<p><br><h3><font color="brown">Moreover, the monument will also be the place where Jose Rizal’s body remains for his sacrifice and love for the country. Subsequently as the years passed by Luneta Park was named to Rizal Park in the honor of Jose Rizal.</font></h3></br></p>
<p><br><h3><font color="brown">Rizal Park was designed by a Swiss sculpturer named Richard Kissling. A bronze granite monument was constructed in honor of Jose Rizal was also built in Luneta to serve as a symbolic area of the park. After seventeen years have passed since Jose Rizal’s execution in 1896, Rizal Monument was finished in the year 1913. Fast forward to the year 1961, Rizal Park was refurbish but it resulted in an untainted steel pylon being overlay above the stonework pillar of the Rizal Monument. For this reason the structure’s height became 30.5 meters. Nevertheless, the adjustment was generally disapproved and the pylon was removed the following year.</font></h3></br></p>
